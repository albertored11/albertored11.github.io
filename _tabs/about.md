## `$ whoami` (Who am I?)

I am Alberto Redondo, aka Herbort, a 24-year-old Computer Science Engineering student at [Facultad de Informática](https://informatica.ucm.es/), [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://ucm.es/), in Madrid, Spain. I am currently on my last year. I am also working as a trainee in a DevOps position.

Ever since I was a kid, I've always been interested in technology, especially in computers, and I used to spend hours in front of my PC, tinkering with anything that caught my attention. I didn't achieve big things (I didn't even learn a single programming language), but I've always been interested in learning more and more, and people around me said computers were my thing and now I think they were right.

Since then, my curiosity has only become bigger, and I constantly keep tinkering with my computer and learning new things. In 2017, I started my Computer Science Engineering studies at UCM, and I have learned a lot of things about different fields: programming paradigms and languages, computers, maths, databases, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer networks, AI...

I am a very curious person, and I am constantly looking forward to learn anything I can. I love to discover new things, to explore alternatives, and to think about different ways to get the same result.

## `$ herbort --help` (What is this website?)

I've always wanted to have my own website. Nothing too special, but personal. My idea is to have a blog about anything related to computers that I find interesting to share with others: stuff I've learned or created, tutorials, what I do in my studies...

Feel free to share my posts!
