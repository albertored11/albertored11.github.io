## `$ whoami` (Who am I?)

I am Alberto Redondo, aka Herbort, a 23-year-old Computer Science Engineering student at [Facultad de Inform√°tica](https://informatica.ucm.es/), [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://ucm.es/), in Madrid, Spain. I am currently on my last year.

Ever since I was a kid, I've always been interested in technology, especially in computers, and I used to spend hours in front of my PC, tinkering with anything that caught my attention. I didn't achieve big things (I didn't even learn a single programming language), but I've always been interested in learning more and more, and people around me said computers were my thing and now I think they were right.

Since then, my curiosity has only become bigger, and I constantly keep tinkering with my computer and learning new things. In 2017, I started my Computer Science Engineering studies at UCM, and I have learned a lot of things about different fields: programming paradigms and languages, computers, maths, databases, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer networks, AI...

And, of course, I have another interests besides computers! I like listening to music (especially, EDM), watching TV shows, animation movies and anime, playing videogames on Nintendo consoles, spending time with friends, cooking and baking, playing board games, running, learning English and travelling around the world.

### Interests

These are my main interests:

* Linux and system administration (I love command line and I use Arch BTW)
* Programming paradigms and languages
* Problem solving through algorithms and data structures
* Learning and understanding how things work
* etc, etc.

## `$ herbort --help` (What is this website?)

I've always wanted to have my own website. Nothing too special, but personal. My idea is to have a blog about anything related to computers that I find interesting to share with others: stuff I've learned or created, tutorials, what I do in my studies...

Feel free to share my posts!
