In most Linux desktop environments, those two keys work out-of-the-box for the laptop display, but… what about external displays? Recently I got a new keyboard, and I was surprised to see those brightness keys. Since I’m using it for my desktop PC, at first I thought ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>SSD + HDD storage setup in a Linux desktop with bind mount</title><link href="https://herbort.me/posts/ssd-hdd-storage-setup-in-a-linux-desktop-with-bind-mount/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SSD + HDD storage setup in a Linux desktop with bind mount" /><published>2021-10-29T18:36:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-01-04T22:35:16+01:00</updated> <id>https://herbort.me/posts/ssd-hdd-storage-setup-in-a-linux-desktop-with-bind-mount/</id> <content src="https://herbort.me/posts/ssd-hdd-storage-setup-in-a-linux-desktop-with-bind-mount/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Redondo</name> </author> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="System administration" /> <summary> Hi everyone! Today I’m going to share with you how I have set up my storage in my desktop PC using a 250 GB SSD and a 2 TB HDD. Background Back in august 2020, I built my own desktop PC with the help of a friend, and the storage I decided to use was: a Samsung MZ-V7S250BW 250 GB NVMe M.2 SSD and a Seagate ST2000DM008 Barracuda 2TB HDD And my choice for the main OS was Linux (specifica... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>bsptab — tabs in bspwm with tabbed!</title><link href="https://herbort.me/posts/bsptab-tabs-in-bspwm-with-tabbed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="bsptab — tabs in bspwm with tabbed!" /><published>2021-09-02T14:39:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-12-12T19:10:08+01:00</updated> <id>https://herbort.me/posts/bsptab-tabs-in-bspwm-with-tabbed/</id> <content src="https://herbort.me/posts/bsptab-tabs-in-bspwm-with-tabbed/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Redondo</name> </author> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="Window Management" /> <summary> Today, I’m going to show you a project I’ve been working on the last days. It is now more than two years that I came back to Linux. I tried Manjaro first, then moved to Arch. And at first I used KDE Plasma as my desktop environment, but I’ve always been curious about using a standalone tiling window manager, so a few months ago I took that step and tried bspwm and i3. Now, bspwm has become ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Automatically cleaning pacman and yay cache in Arch Linux</title><link href="https://herbort.me/posts/automatically-cleaning-pacman-and-yay-cache-in-arch-linux/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automatically cleaning pacman and yay cache in Arch Linux" /><published>2021-03-29T19:16:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-01-04T22:35:16+01:00</updated> <id>https://herbort.me/posts/automatically-cleaning-pacman-and-yay-cache-in-arch-linux/</id> <content src="https://herbort.me/posts/automatically-cleaning-pacman-and-yay-cache-in-arch-linux/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Redondo</name> </author> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="System administration" /> <summary> Let’s talk about something interesting for Arch Linux(-based) distros: automating package cache cleaning. Cleaning pacman cache pacman is the official package manager for Arch. When using it to install a package from official repositories, it gets donwloaded, stored in our system (specifically, in /var/cache/pacman/pkg), and finally it is installed and the package file stays there, in case we... </summary> </entry> </feed>
